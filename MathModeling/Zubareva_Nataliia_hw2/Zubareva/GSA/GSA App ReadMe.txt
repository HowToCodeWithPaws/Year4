Hello!

This is the brief introduction to the GSA desktop application
It visualizes the Gravity Search Algorithm metaheuristic for finding optimal solutions of some mathematical functions.
The application allows to select a function (linear, square, or a mathematical translation of the optimal power flow problem
for the bus system vith valve-point effects). You can choose the type of optimum the algorithm will be searching for,
the condition for finishing, the number of agents (up to 100), gravity parameters, etc.

It is possible to set up to 10 dimensions with minimal and maximal values, along which the function will be optimized. 
However, only two dimensions will be dynamic (set those with checkboxes) and the movement of agents along them will be
plotted on the graph. For the rest of the dimensions, choose a fixed value that will be applied in the function.

To confirm the values of the parameters, press the Apply button, to clear all of the information and redraw the form anew - the Clear one.
To start the simulation, press Start. Then, agents will be generated, and from there you have two options: to view the 
simulation as an animation, without participation, press Play; or control the iterations manually by pressing --> for the next iteration
and <-- to return to the previous. To step the simulation regardless of the operation mode, press Stop.

Additionally, check Show traces checkbox to plot lines between the agents' current and previous positions, Write to files to export 
information on best solutions, difference in them (convergence) and positions of agents along dynamic dimensions between iterations to txt files.
To draw plots of best solutions and convergence, press Plots.

To run the program, start the GSA.exe file and enjoy the view. The app also supports tab navigation, so try that as well.
